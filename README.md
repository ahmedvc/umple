#Umple Modelling Language

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/umple-ucosp/umple.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/umple-ucosp/umple)

##Introduction

This is the main project for various Umple subprojects and components.

Umple is a model-oriented programming technology. It allows developers to embed modelling concepts (e.g. associations, state machines), patterns and other abstractions in traditional code, and vice versa. It generates high quality code for Java, C++ and PhP (and can be embedded in or embed these), as well as diagrams, metrics and many other artifacts.

The project homepage is located at http://umple.org/

##Development
Umple is developed in itself, guaranteeing robustness, hence the Umple compiler has to be distributed with the source (in the releases directory).

Development follows a model-driven, test-driven, agile, continuous-integration process. Umple is hosted on Github at https://github.com/umple/umple.

Umple has been largely developed as a research project at the University of Ottawa, Canada, by numerous PhD and masters students, Many undergraduates from across Canada and the USA have also contributed. See the license file for the list of contributors.

Umple is continuously tested and build on Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org/).
